State transitions come only from the fixed declared matrix; no ad-hoc transition.

```review
Every state transition is looked up in the fixed declared `_TRANSITIONS` matrix (via
compute_target_state); no module computes or assigns a change's state through an
ad-hoc transition outside this table. On any change to transitions.py, confirm the
matrix remains the sole source of transitions and no hardcoded/ad-hoc state change
was introduced elsewhere. Still holds -> `decision reconcile d-fixed-transition-matrix`;
broken -> `decision betray d-fixed-transition-matrix` with a justification.
```
